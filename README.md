## ‚öôÔ∏è Environment Variables

**Do not push sensitive keys to GitHub**. You should follow [Next.js' Guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) for environment variables.

This includes:

- **.env.local**: Use a `.env.local` file for any sensitive keys. These should not be pushed to GitHub.
- **.env**: Use a `.env` file for any application configuration that can be safely committed to GitHub, such as a `PORT` value.
